\section{Introduction}

I consider an important contribution of my paper to be able to distinguish clearly between score and non-score effects of schools.
To that effect, it seems very important to think of a model where we can separate both school effects. 
In the next section I try to put forward a series of facts that motivate and simplify this process. 
I then describe the model I intend to use in Section 3 and compare it with others used on the literature.
In section 4, I put forward a simulation exercise that explains the issues of studying school effects without a model. 
Section 5 discusses how I intend to estimate this model and section 6 concludes.
